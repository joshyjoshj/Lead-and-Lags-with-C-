## Introduction

A collection of functions for working with lags in a dataframe coded in C++ and used in r via `rcpp`. This is my first attempt coding with C++ so I'm sure these aren't the most efficent code  (they're just loops). I will include bechmarking to any equivilent functions.

I will try and update these when I create a new function

## Lags
